# Project Understanding

This is an Anki flashcard template project that creates interactive drag-and-drop fill-in-the-blank exercises. The project serves as a showcase of Claude Code's development capabilities.

## Key Understanding:
- It's a complete educational tool built entirely with Claude Code assistance
- Creates interactive flashcards where users drag words/phrases to fill blanks in sentences
- Uses HTML5 drag-and-drop API for cross-platform compatibility (Anki Desktop, AnkiWeb, mobile)
- Features visual feedback, randomization, and flexible input formatting
- Targets various learning domains (language, medical, history, coding)

## Primary Purpose:
Demonstrate Claude Code's ability to build complete, functional projects while solving a real need for Anki users who want more interactive learning experiences.

The project appears to be a legitimate educational tool focused on enhancing learning through interactive exercises.

# AI Collaboration Methodology Documentation

## About Mengni's_CLAUDE_CODE_JOURNEY.md

This file serves as a professional showcase of sophisticated AI collaboration methodology, demonstrating that effective work with AI coding agents requires strategic thinking, clear communication, and active partnership—not automated "magic button" solutions.

### Core Purpose
Document the end-to-end AI collaboration process across the entire project lifecycle, showcasing:
- Strategic communication skills and effective AI agent guidance
- Active project steering and decision-making capabilities  
- Best practices and techniques for maximizing Claude Code effectiveness
- Real-world examples of sophisticated AI partnership approaches

### Living Documentation Process
This is a work-in-progress document updated each collaboration session to capture:
- **Session-by-Session Learning**: Techniques that worked, challenges faced, solutions discovered
- **Real-Time Methodology Evolution**: How collaboration approaches improve through practice
- **Practical Tips Collection**: Concrete communication patterns and effective prompting strategies
- **Iterative Expertise Development**: Growing sophistication in AI partnership skills

### Update Requirements
During each session, we should:
- Document new learnings in "Project-Specific Insights"
- Add practical tips that prove effective
- Record any pivots, challenges, or breakthrough moments
- Refine methodology based on collaborative discoveries

### Meta-Objective
This document itself demonstrates sophisticated AI collaboration by simultaneously building the Anki template while documenting and refining our partnership methodology in real-time.

# Best Practices Reference

## Available Resource
`anthropic_blog_claude_code_best_practices.md` contains comprehensive Claude Code best practices and advanced techniques.

## Collaborative Guidance Protocol
- Reference best practices document when workflows could be optimized
- Suggest specific improvements based on established patterns
- Provide reasoning for recommendations while respecting user decisions
- Proactively guide toward more effective approaches when beneficial

## Application
Use best practices knowledge to:
- Recommend optimal workflows (Explore → Plan → Code → Commit)
- Suggest thinking modes for complex problems
- Improve collaboration efficiency
- Enhance project outcomes through proven techniques
