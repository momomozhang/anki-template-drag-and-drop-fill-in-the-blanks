# Anki Project: Claude Code Collaboration Journey

## Executive Summary

This document showcases the sophisticated methodology and strategic approach required for effective AI-assisted development. Working with Claude Code isn't about "pressing a button and magic happens" - it's a skilled collaboration that demands strategic thinking, clear communication, and active project steering.

## Core Methodology: AI Partnership as a Professional Skill

### The Partnership Principle
Effective AI collaboration requires treating the AI agent as a skilled partner rather than an automated tool. This means:
- **Strategic Communication**: Learning to frame problems, provide context, and guide the conversation
- **Active Steering**: Understanding when to redirect, refine, or pivot approaches
- **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: Leveraging AI strengths while maintaining human oversight and decision-making

## Project-Specific Application: Anki Drag-and-Drop Template

### Phase 1: Project Initiation & Strategic Planning
**Strategic Innovation:**
- Built multi-layer guidance framework: best practices documentation feeds into project instructions, enabling AI to provide collaborative guidance back to the user
- Transformed project from simple coding task into professional showcase of sophisticated AI partnership skills
- Created methodology for continuous improvement through session-by-session documentation

**Meta-Achievement:** Developed system where AI becomes an active partner in optimizing the human-AI collaboration process, using established best practices to guide both parties toward better outcomes.


## Tips

## During planning phase, explicitly ask below to get best results:
- "Please do not generate any code yet."
- "Please rephrase my requirements to demonstrate your understanding. If you have questions, please ask."
- when create plans or documentation, can ask "Please create 3 versions." "Which versions do you think is the best? why?"

## When an answer is not satisfatory, you can refine your question by press *esc* twice to go back to edit the question.
