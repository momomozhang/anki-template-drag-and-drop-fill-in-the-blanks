# Anki Project: Claude Code Collaboration Journey

## Executive Summary

This document showcases the sophisticated methodology and strategic approach required for effective AI-assisted development. Working with Claude Code isn't about "pressing a button and magic happens" - it's a skilled collaboration that demands strategic thinking, clear communication, and active project steering.

## Core Methodology: AI Partnership as a Professional Skill

### The Partnership Principle
Effective AI collaboration requires treating the AI agent as a skilled partner rather than an automated tool. This means:
- **Strategic Communication**: Learning to frame problems, provide context, and guide the conversation
- **Active Steering**: Understanding when to redirect, refine, or pivot approaches
- **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: Leveraging AI strengths while maintaining human oversight and decision-making

## Project-Specific Application: Anki Drag-and-Drop Template

### Phase 1: Project Initiation & Strategic Planning
**Strategic Innovation:**
- Built multi-layer guidance framework: best practices documentation feeds into project instructions, enabling AI to provide collaborative guidance back to the user
- Transformed project from simple coding task into professional showcase of sophisticated AI partnership skills
- Created methodology for continuous improvement through session-by-session documentation

**Meta-Achievement:** Developed system where AI becomes an active partner in optimizing the human-AI collaboration process, using established best practices to guide both parties toward better outcomes.


## Tips

## During planning phase, explicitly ask below to get best results:
- "Please do not generate any code yet."
- "Please rephrase my requirements to demonstrate your understanding. If you have questions, please ask."
- when create plans or documentation, can ask "Please create 3 versions." "Which versions do you think is the best? why?"

## When an answer is not satisfatory, you can refine your question by press *esc* twice to go back to edit the question.

## Give Claude links, documents or images to understand the project requirements or learn from similar existing projects

### Project-Specific Insights

#### Session 2: Requirements Discovery & Implementation

**Key Learning**: The importance of the **Explore → Plan → Code** workflow when requirements seemed unclear initially.

**Challenge**: I jumped to coding without fully understanding the user's mental model of "Cloze-style UI for drag-and-drop."

**Breakthrough Moment**: When user said "discard all coding work" and referenced the best practices document, it demonstrated the power of following structured AI collaboration workflows.

**Technical Insights**:
- Successfully implemented inline drag-and-drop (innovation over existing separate drop-zone patterns)
- Combined editor and study modes in single template
- Requirement refinement through iterative clarification (answer section color coding)

**Methodology Win**: Using documentation-first approach (CLAUDE.md updates) to capture requirements before implementation prevented future misunderstandings.

#### Session 4: Complex Problem Solving & Research-Driven Solutions

**Major Challenge**: Add-on automation completely non-functional despite extensive previous attempts

**Strategic Approach**: after multiple failed debugging sessions, I connect Claude Code with Zen MCP to research online the root cause. Together the AI studied multiple working anki template and found the solution.

**Technical Breakthrough**: 
- **Root Cause**: Wrong architectural approach (JavaScript vs native Qt APIs)
- **Solution**: Simple `editor.web.selectedText()` property access
- **Result**: Replaced 500+ lines of failed code with ~20 lines of working automation

**Meta-Learning**: This session demonstrated sophisticated problem-solving methodologies available when combining Claude Code with advanced tools (Zen MCP). The systematic research and analysis capabilities enabled solving a problem that seemed impossible through traditional approaches.
