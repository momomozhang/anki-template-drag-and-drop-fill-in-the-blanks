## ðŸ¤– Claude Code Development Showcase

**A complete project built entirely with Claude Code - from concept to deployment**

This interactive fill-in-the-blank flashcard system for Anki demonstrates the power of AI-assisted development using Claude Code. Every line of code, documentation, feature, as well as git & Github actions was created through collaborative programming with Claude Code agent.

### ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
- **Primary**: Showcase Claude Code's capability to build complete, functional projects âœ…
- **Secondary**: Solve real Anki users' need for interactive drag-and-drop flashcards âœ…

### âœ¨ Features
Transform any text into an engaging learning exercise where words or phrases are removed from sentences and become draggable items that students must place back in the correct positions.

- **Drag & Drop Interface**: HTML5 native drag-and-drop API
- **Visual Feedback**: Instant success/error indicators  
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Anki Desktop, AnkiWeb, and mobile apps
- **Randomization**: Shuffled item order prevents pattern memorization
- **Smart Parsing**: Automatically extracts draggable items from `[[d1::text]]` syntax
- **Streamlined Workflow**: No manual field population required

### ðŸ’¡ Use Cases
- Language learning (vocabulary, grammar)
- Medical terminology
- Historical facts and dates
- Code syntax practice

### ðŸ“‹ Project Status
- âœ… **Templates**: Fully functional drag-and-drop interface
- âœ… **Cross-platform**: Works on all Anki platforms
- âœ… **Add-on automation**: **FIXED** - Working automation using native Qt APIs

**The project is now complete** - both interactive templates and automation work perfectly.

### ðŸ”§ **Technical Solutions Summary**

#### **Automation Fix (Session 4)**
**Problem**: 500+ lines of JavaScript selection monitoring failed in QtWebEngine  
**Solution**: Native Qt APIs using `editor.web.selectedText()`  
**Result**: Reliable text selection and blank creation with Ctrl+Shift+D

#### **Template Rendering Fix (Session 6)**
**Problem**: Complete front-side template failure - blank display, no content  
**Root Causes**: DOMContentLoaded timing + field substitution + variable scope issues  
**Solution**: Multi-part fix:
- IIFE pattern for proper variable scoping
- Conditional rendering `{{#Question}}...{{/Question}}`
- Hidden div pattern for reliable field access
- Immediate execution without DOM events

**Result**: Fully functional interactive template with cloze-style blanks and draggable items

**Key Insight**: Anki's web environment requires specialized patterns different from standard web development.
