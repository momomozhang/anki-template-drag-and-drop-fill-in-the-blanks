## 🤖 Claude Code Development Showcase

**A complete project built entirely with Claude Code - from concept to deployment**

This interactive fill-in-the-blank flashcard system for Anki demonstrates the power of AI-assisted development using Claude Code. Every line of code, documentation, feature, as well as git & Github actions was created through collaborative programming with Claude Code agent.

### 🎯 Project Goals
- **Primary**: Showcase Claude Code's capability to build complete, functional projects ✅
- **Secondary**: Solve real Anki users' need for interactive drag-and-drop flashcards ✅

### ✨ Features
Transform any text into an engaging learning exercise where words or phrases are removed from sentences and become draggable items that students must place back in the correct positions.

- **Drag & Drop Interface**: HTML5 native drag-and-drop API
- **Visual Feedback**: Instant success/error indicators  
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Anki Desktop, AnkiWeb, and mobile apps
- **Randomization**: Shuffled item order prevents pattern memorization
- **Flexible Input**: Support multiple blanks using pipe separator (`|`)

### 💡 Use Cases
- Language learning (vocabulary, grammar)
- Medical terminology
- Historical facts and dates
- Code syntax practice

### 📋 Project Status
- ✅ **Templates**: Fully functional drag-and-drop interface
- ✅ **Cross-platform**: Works on all Anki platforms
- ❌ **Add-on automation**: Non-functional due to Anki editor limitations

**The core functionality is complete** - interactive drag-and-drop flashcards work perfectly.
