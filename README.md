## ü§ñ Claude Code Development Showcase

**A complete project built entirely with Claude Code - from concept to deployment**

In this repo, every line of code, documentation, feature, as well as git & Github actions was created through collaborative programming with Claude Code agent. What's my point? Claude Code is no magic, you still need to learn & practice how to use it!

Check `documentation` folder for the learnings!
